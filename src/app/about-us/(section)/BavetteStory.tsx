              What began as a dream between two food-loving friends
              quickly turned into a landmark for steak enthusiasts. In 2010, founders Alex and James combined their love of gourmet dining with a single mission: to create a place where steak isn`t just a meal but a celebration. From humble beginnings in a small kitchen to becoming a renowned steakhouse, Ora has never lost its roots in quality, craftsmanship, and a love for the community.

              <br />
              Each cut, carefully selected and perfectly prepared, tells the story of years spent honing our craft. And while we`ve grown over the years, our mission remains the sameâ€”to deliver the finest experience in every bite.
